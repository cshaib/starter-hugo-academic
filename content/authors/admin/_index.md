I am a PhD student at the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), advised by [Byron Wallace](https://www.byronwallace.com/). My research is motivated by parsing through the vast amount of biomedical literature using natural language processing systems.

I received my MSc in Applied Computing at the [University of Toronto](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/), where I worked on NLP problems in clinical contexts, and was advised by [Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/). During that time, I was awarded the [Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate/fellowship) for my work in extending AI into operating rooms. Before that, I received my BSc in Neuroscience at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/neuroscience/).

Outside of research, I am the Vice-Chair and Chief Strategy Officer at [HER CODE CAMP](http://hercodecamp.com/), a not-for-profit organization that aims to empower under-represented communities in technology.
